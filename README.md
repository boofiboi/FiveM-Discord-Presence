# **FiveM Discord Rich Presence**

### I am planning an entire rewrite of this.

## Fully customizable, open source script to create a custom, "high effort" rich presence for your server. 
The script itself is not framework dependent, but without a framework most styles currently included don't work. 
Although ESX compatibility was not tested, it should function properly.


# Installation

 1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/releases) tab
 2. Place the folder inside of the archive anywhere in your resources folder
 3. Configure the script according to the config file and the [Wiki](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Configuration)
 4. Put `ensure Discord-Presence` anywhere in your server.cfg
 5. Restart your server or start the resource through TxAdmin

# Usage

The script itself does not have any usable commands/events.  (This will get changed in a later update as of 15.5.24!)

# Issues?

Are the comments in the config not enough? Try looking [here](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Configuration) or 
create a new [issue](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/issues/new)

# Contributing new presence styles
#### Do you have a new style for the presence in mind and want it included? You can do 2 things:

 1. Add it into the script yourself according to the [Wiki](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Creating-a-new-style) and then submit a pull request.
 2. Create a new issue describing how you want it to look, and depending if I like it I might add it into the script.

# Final words

This is my first proper script (Before creating this I only edited scripts I found online) so any criticism/improvements are appreciated.
