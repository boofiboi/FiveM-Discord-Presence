# **FiveM Discord Rich Presence**
Fully customizable, open source script to create a custom, "high effort" rich presence for your server. 

The script itself is not framework dependent, but without a framework most styles currently included don't work. 

# Installation

 1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/releases) tab
 2. Place the folder inside of the archive anywhere in your resources folder
 3. Configure the script according to the config file and the [Wiki](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Configuration)
 4. Put `ensure FiveM-Discord-Presence` at the bottom of your server.cfg
 5. Restart your server or start the resource through TxAdmin

# Usage

The script itself does not have any usable commands/events. This will change soon.

# Issues?

Are the comments in the config not enough? Try looking [here](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/wiki/Configuration) or 
create a new [issue](https://github.com/boofiboi/FiveM-Discord-Presence/issues/new)

# Final words

Big thanks to Virtual Vision Studios over on discord, who helped me catch a lot of errors.
