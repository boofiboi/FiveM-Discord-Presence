    This is the first version of a script I plan to support with more styles, functions and possibly even commands to change between these presets on a per player base.
    Issues will solely be resolved on the Github. You can also suggest new styles/features

Config.Framework = 'CHANGEME' -- ESX, QB, STANDALONE | Consider using a framework with this script, as a lot of the functions are based on a framework. Defaults to QBCore
Config.Delay = 5000 -- Delay between presence updates, in ms.
--[[ Change this to whatever you like, previews are available on Github: 
healthdisplay // QB, ESX and STANDALONE - Shows the player health as coloured squares, if using QB shows a hospital emoji when knocked down. And when dead shows a skull on either.
location // QB and ESX, STANDALONE - Shows the street the player is on.
nameandid // QB, ESX - Shows the player's character name and the player ID.
custom // QB, ESX, STANDALONE - Shows custom text, if more than one option is present in the Config.CustomText array, will randomly cycle through them.

Don't like these options? Create an issue on the github with your idea and I may add it.
