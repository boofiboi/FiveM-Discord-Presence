healthdisplay // QB, ESX and STANDALONE - Shows the player health as coloured squares, if using QB shows a hospital emoji when knocked down. And when dead shows a skull on either.
location // QB and ESX, STANDALONE - Shows the street the player is on.
nameandid // QB, ESX - Shows the player's character name and the player ID.
custom // QB, ESX, STANDALONE - Shows custom text, if more than one option is present in the Config.CustomText array, will randomly cycle through them.
playercount // QB, ESX, STANDALONE - Shows the current amount of players online on the server.

BigText = 'healthdisplay'
SmallText = 'location'
Line1 = 'nameandid'
